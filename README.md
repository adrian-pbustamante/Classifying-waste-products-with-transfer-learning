# Classifying-waste-products-with-transfer-learning

## Objective 

The aim of the project is to develop an automated waste classification model that can accurately differentiate between recyclable and organic waste based on images. The project will use transfer learning, and fine-tuning, with a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify images.

## About the data

Dataset is divided into train data (85%) and test data (15%)   Dataset is divided into two classes R (recyclable) and O (organic)

Training data - 22564 images  Test data - 2513 images
